          This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>The Key Coach</strong> collects, uses, shares, and protects personal
          information when you visit our pages related to the <strong>Weekly Reset Worksheet</strong> (including the
          landing page and thank-you page), and when you request or receive the worksheet.
        </p>
        <p class="small">
          Summary: We collect the information needed to deliver the worksheet (typically your email address) and basic
          technical information needed to operate the site. We also capture UTM parameters/referrer information for up
          to <strong>7 days</strong> for attribution.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>Who this is for (adults / children under 13)</h2>
      <p>
        The Weekly Reset Worksheet is intended for adults (parents/guardians and educators). We do not knowingly collect
        personal information from children under 13. If we learn we have collected personal information from a child
        under 13, we will delete it.
      </p>

      <h2>Information we collect</h2>
      <p>We may collect the following categories of information:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Information you provide</strong> (for example, when you request the Weekly Reset Worksheet):
          your email address, and any other fields you choose to submit (such as first name, if present).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Attribution information</strong> (UTM/referrer capture): we may collect and store
          <code>utm_source</code>, <code>utm_medium</code>, <code>utm_campaign</code>, <code>utm_content</code>,
          <code>utm_term</code>, <code>referrer</code>, and <code>landing_page</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Technical and usage information</strong>: device/browser type, approximate location (derived from IP),
          pages viewed, timestamps, and similar log data that helps us operate and secure the site.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How we use information</h2>
      <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Deliver the Weekly Reset Worksheet and related messages you requested.</li>
        <li>Provide customer support and respond to requests.</li>
        <li>Maintain the security and integrity of our site and systems.</li>
        <li>
          Understand which links/campaigns are driving sign-ups (attribution), so we can improve the relevance of our
          content and communications.
        </li>
        <li>Comply with legal obligations and enforce our terms.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>UTM/referrer capture and 7-day attribution storage</h2>
      <p>
        When you visit our pages, we may capture campaign attribution parameters and referral information and store them
        for up to <strong>7 days</strong>. This helps us understand how visitors found the Weekly Reset Worksheet.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Fields:</strong> utm_source, utm_medium, utm_campaign, utm_content, utm_term, referrer, landing_page
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Storage:</strong> typically browser storage (such as localStorage and/or cookies) and may also be
          transmitted with form submissions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Retention window:</strong> 7 days
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Storage key used by this site:</strong>
          <code>the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset_attr_v1</code>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="small">
        If you clear your browser storage/cookies or use certain privacy tools, attribution information may be deleted
        sooner.
      </p>

      <h2>Cookies and similar technologies</h2>
      <p>
        We may use cookies, localStorage, and similar technologies for essential site functionality, attribution
        tracking (as described above), and security. Your browser may allow you to remove or block cookies and site
        data; note that some features may not function properly if you do.
      </p>

      <h2>How we share information</h2>
      <p>
        We do not sell your personal information. We may share information in the following limited circumstances:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Service providers</strong> that help us run the site and deliver communications (for example, website
          hosting and email delivery/automation). They are permitted to process personal information only to provide
          services to us.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Legal and safety</strong> reasons: to comply with law, respond to lawful requests, protect rights and
          safety, or prevent fraud/abuse.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Business transitions</strong>: if we are involved in a merger, acquisition, financing, or sale of
          assets, information may be transferred as part of that transaction, subject to appropriate safeguards.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Hosting and infrastructure</h2>
      <p>
        These pages are hosted on infrastructure that may be provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS), including Amazon S3.
        Like most hosting providers, AWS and related systems may process technical data (such as IP addresses and server
        logs) to provide and secure the service.
      </p>

      <h2>Email communications and opt-out</h2>
      <p>
        If you request the Weekly Reset Worksheet, we may email you the resource and send related follow-up messages
        connected to the worksheet. You can opt out of non-essential emails at any time by using the unsubscribe link in
        the email (if provided) or by replying to the email with <strong>unsubscribe</strong>.
      </p>

      <h2>Data retention</h2>
      <p>
        We keep personal information only as long as necessary for the purposes described in this policy, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>To deliver the Weekly Reset Worksheet and maintain the subscriber relationship you requested.</li>
        <li>To comply with legal obligations and resolve disputes.</li>
        <li>To maintain security logs and prevent abuse.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Attribution information described above is intended to persist for up to <strong>7 days</strong> in browser
        storage, subject to your browser settings and actions.
      </p>

      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>
        We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect personal information.
        However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
      </p>

      <h2>Your rights and choices</h2>
      <p>
        Depending on where you live, you may have rights to request access, correction, deletion, or information about
