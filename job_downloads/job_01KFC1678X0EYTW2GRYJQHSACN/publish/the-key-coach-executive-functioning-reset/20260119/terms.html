        <p>
          These Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern your use of The Key Coach webpages that provide access to the
          <strong>Weekly Reset Worksheet</strong> (the “Resource”), including the landing page and thank-you page.
          By accessing or using the site or Resource, you agree to these Terms.
        </p>
        <p class="small">
          If you do not agree, do not use the site or Resource.
        </p>

      <h2>1) Educational purpose; not medical, psychological, or therapeutic services</h2>
      <p>
        The site content and the Weekly Reset Worksheet are provided for general educational planning and skill-building
        purposes only. They are not medical advice, psychological advice, therapy, counseling, diagnosis, treatment, or
        a substitute for individualized guidance from qualified professionals.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have concerns about attention, learning, behavior, or mental health, seek help from a qualified
        professional (for example, a pediatrician, licensed mental health professional, or other appropriate provider).
        If you believe you or someone else may be in immediate danger, contact emergency services right away.
      </p>

      <h2>2) No guarantees; outcomes vary</h2>
      <p>
        The Weekly Reset Worksheet is a planning tool designed to support organization and follow-through. Outcomes
        depend on many factors (including consistency, individual needs, and the student’s setting and support).
        We do not guarantee any specific academic, behavioral, or other outcome from using the Resource.
      </p>
      <p class="small">
        Any time estimates (including references to a “30-minute workflow”) are informational and may vary by person and
        situation.
      </p>

      <h2>3) Intended audience; children under 13</h2>
      <p>
        The Resource is intended for adults (parents/guardians and educators). If you are under 13, do not submit
        personal information through the site. If we learn we have collected personal information from a child under 13,
        we will delete it.
      </p>

      <h2>4) License and permitted use of the Weekly Reset Worksheet</h2>
      <p>
