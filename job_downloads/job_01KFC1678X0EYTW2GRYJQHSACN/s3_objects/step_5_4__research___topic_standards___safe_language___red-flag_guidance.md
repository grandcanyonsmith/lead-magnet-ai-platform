## Standards table (US-focused) — safe marketing + privacy + email compliance

| Topic area | Safe phrasing (use) | What NOT to say (avoid) | Source URL |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Truth-in-advertising baseline (truthful, not misleading, evidence-based)** | “A practical weekly planning worksheet for tracking assignments, due dates, and materials.” / “Designed to support organization and planning skills.” | “Works for every student.” / “Proven to raise grades fast.” / “The only solution you need.” | `https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/media-resources/truth-advertising` ([ftc.gov](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/media-resources/truth-advertising?utm_source=openai)) |
| **Substantiation: have a reasonable basis before making objective claims** | “Many families find that writing deadlines in one place improves visibility.” (Keep it framed as a general observation, not a quantified promise.) / “Includes a 30‑minute weekly routine.” | “Research proves this worksheet improves executive functioning.” / “Tests show it prevents missing work.” | `https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/ftc-policy-statement-regarding-advertising-substantiation` ([ftc.gov](https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/ftc-policy-statement-regarding-advertising-substantiation?utm_source=openai)) |
| **Be cautious with “studies show / experts recommend / clinically proven” phrasing** | “Built around common planning routines used in schools and homes.” / “Simple, repeatable workflow.” | “Studies show…” (unless you actually have the level/type of evidence the wording implies) / “Doctor‑recommended.” | `https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/ftc-policy-statement-regarding-advertising-substantiation` ([ftc.gov](https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/ftc-policy-statement-regarding-advertising-substantiation?utm_source=openai)) |
| **Avoid health/mental-health claims unless you can meet higher substantiation standards** | Keep positioning as **educational planning + skill-building**: “organization,” “planning,” “time blocks,” “homework routines.” | “Helps with ADHD/anxiety/depression” / “Replaces professional evaluation” / “A clinical intervention” | `https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/health-products-compliance-guidance` ([ftc.gov](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/health-products-compliance-guidance?utm_source=openai)) |
| **Executive function definitions (use accurate, non-diagnostic framing)** | “Executive function skills help with planning, focusing attention, switching tasks, and juggling information.” | “This worksheet diagnoses executive function problems.” / “This worksheet evaluates ADHD.” | `https://developingchild.harvard.edu/science/key-concepts/executive-function/` ([developingchild.harvard.edu](https://developingchild.harvard.edu/science/key-concepts/executive-function/?utm_source=openai)) |
| **When mentioning ADHD or similar concerns, route to qualified care (scope boundary)** | “If you have concerns about attention or learning, consider talking with a qualified healthcare professional.” | “No need to consult a pediatrician/clinician.” / “This replaces clinical evaluation.” | `https://www.cdc.gov/adhd/hcp/treatment-recommendations/index.html` ([cdc.gov](https://www.cdc.gov/adhd/hcp/treatment-recommendations/index.html?utm_source=openai)) |
| **Testimonials & typicality: don’t imply “exceptional results are typical”** | Prefer **non-outcome** testimonials: “I like having everything in one place.” / If you include outcome-oriented testimonials, pair with a **generally expected** (substantiated) statement. | “My child went from failing to straight A’s in two weeks.” / “Everyone can expect the same outcome.” | `https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/ftcs-endorsement-guides` ([ftc.gov](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/ftcs-endorsement-guides?utm_source=openai)) |
| **Disclaimers like “Results vary” often don’t fix a typicality impression** | If an endorsement implies a measurable outcome, either (a) substantiate typical performance, or (b) clearly disclose generally expected performance for similar users. | Relying only on “Results vary” / “Not typical” style disclaimers to cure the net impression. | `https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/16/255.2` ([law.cornell.edu](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/16/255.2?utm_source=openai)) |
| **Material connections (affiliates/influencers/comped products/paid testimonials)** | “I received [free access/discount/compensation] and am sharing my experience.” / “I may earn a commission if you purchase through my link.” | No disclosure of payment/free product/commission when it could affect credibility. | `https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/16/255.5` ([law.cornell.edu](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/16/255.5?utm_source=openai)) |
| **Influencer disclosure placement: clear + hard to miss** | Put disclosures **with** the endorsement, not buried in a profile or after “more.” Use plain language (“Ad”, “Paid partnership”, “I earn commissions”). | Hidden disclosures / vague tags that consumers may not understand. | `https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/disclosures-101-social-media-influencers` ([ftc.gov](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/disclosures-101-social-media-influencers?utm_source=openai)) |
| **Children’s privacy (COPPA): email + persistent identifiers count as personal information** | “This resource is intended for adults (parents/guardians/educators). We don’t knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.” | “Kids: enter your email to get this.” / Operating a child-directed funnel collecting email without parental consent. | `https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/childrens-online-privacy-protection-rule-six-step-compliance-plan-your-business` ([ftc.gov](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/childrens-online-privacy-protection-rule-six-step-compliance-plan-your-business?utm_source=openai)) |
| **COPPA applicability: general-audience sites can still be covered if you have actual knowledge** | Add age/parent framing; avoid child-directed design cues if you can’t run a COPPA flow. | Assuming you’re exempt just because you didn’t ask age, if you later obtain “actual knowledge.” | `https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/childrens-online-privacy-protection-rule-not-just-kids-sites` ([ftc.gov](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/childrens-online-privacy-protection-rule-not-just-kids-sites?utm_source=openai)) |
| **Data minimization + retention + access control** | “We collect only what we need (e.g., email for delivery) and keep it only as long as necessary.” / “Access is limited to those who need it.” | Collecting extra sensitive data “just in case,” or keeping it indefinitely without a business need. | `https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/protecting-personal-information-guide-business` ([ftc.gov](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/protecting-personal-information-guide-business?utm_source=openai)) |
| **Security representations: don’t overstate security** | “We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards.” | “100% secure” / “Unhackable” / Overpromising beyond what you can support operationally. | `https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/start-security-guide-business` ([ftc.gov](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/start-security-guide-business?utm_source=openai)) |
| **Commercial email (CAN-SPAM): accurate headers/subjects, opt-out, physical address** | “You can opt out any time (instructions below).” / Include a valid physical postal address or PO box. | No opt-out method / misleading subject lines / missing address. | `https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2019/02/ftc-completes-review-can-spam-rule` ([ftc.gov](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2019/02/ftc-completes-review-can-spam-rule?utm_source=openai)) |
| **CAN-SPAM rule reference (definitions/implementation)** | For internal compliance docs: “We follow CAN‑SPAM requirements for commercial email primary purpose and opt-out handling.” | Assuming a message is exempt without checking “primary purpose.” | `https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/rules/can-spam-rule` ([ftc.gov](https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/rules/can-spam-rule?utm_source=openai)) |

## Compliance language bank (copy/paste snippets)

These are written to be conservative and compatible with an educational planning worksheet funnel.

### 1) Educational scope (PDF / landing / thank-you)
**Short (fits on PDF page 1):**
- “Educational planning tool. Not medical or psychological advice.”

**Slightly longer (landing page near the form):**
- “This worksheet is for educational planning and skill-building. It does not provide diagnosis or clinical services. If you have concerns about attention, learning, or mental health, consider consulting a qualified professional.” ([cdc.gov](https://www.cdc.gov/adhd/hcp/treatment-recommendations/index.html?utm_source=openai))

**Terms-style scope statement (privacy/terms pages):**
- “Information on this site and in the Weekly Reset Worksheet is general educational information. It is not a substitute for individualized guidance from qualified professionals.”

### 2) Outcomes / expectations (avoid promises)
**Very short:**
- “Outcomes depend on many factors, including consistency and individual needs.”

**Landing page-friendly:**
- “This is a planning tool. It’s designed to support organization and follow-through, but outcomes vary by student, setting, and support.” ([ftc.gov](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/media-resources/truth-advertising?utm_source=openai))

**If you reference “30 minutes”:**
- “The ‘30-minute’ timing is an estimate. Adjust as needed.”

### 3) How to talk about executive function (non-diagnostic framing)
**Definition blurb (PDF page 2 or landing FAQ):**
- “Executive function skills support planning, focus, task-switching, and juggling information—useful for school and daily routines.” ([developingchild.harvard.edu](https://developingchild.harvard.edu/science/key-concepts/executive-function/?utm_source=openai))

**Avoiding condition framing:**
- “This worksheet focuses on routines and systems (what to do next), not labels.”

### 4) When a parent suspects ADHD / learning challenges (referral language)
**Gentle nudge (PDF footer or FAQ):**
- “If you’re concerned about attention, learning, or behavior at school, consider discussing it with your child’s pediatrician or another qualified healthcare professional.” ([cdc.gov](https://www.cdc.gov/adhd/hcp/treatment-recommendations/index.html?utm_source=openai))

### 5) Testimonials / reviews (FTC-safe patterns)
**Safer testimonial prompt (ask for qualitative, not outcome claims):**
- “If you share feedback, focus on what you liked (clarity, structure, ease of use) rather than specific performance outcomes.” ([law.cornell.edu](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/16/255.1?utm_source=openai))

**If you do use a client quote:**
- “Client experience shared with permission. Experiences differ.” ([ftc.gov](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/ftcs-endorsement-guides?utm_source=openai))

**If the endorser received something of value (discount/free access/paid):**
- “Disclosure: I received [discounted/free/paid] access and I’m sharing my honest experience.” ([law.cornell.edu](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/16/255.5?utm_source=openai))

### 6) Affiliate links / influencer disclosures (short options)
- “Disclosure: I may earn a commission if you purchase through links on this page.” ([ftc.gov](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/ftcs-endorsement-guides?utm_source=openai))  
- “Ad / Paid partnership.” ([ftc.gov](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/disclosures-101-social-media-influencers?utm_source=openai))  
- “Sponsored: I was compensated for this post.” ([law.cornell.edu](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/16/255.5?utm_source=openai))

### 7) Minors / COPPA-friendly language (landing + privacy)
**Landing page small print (near form submit):**
- “This resource is intended for parents/guardians and educators. If you are under 13, please ask a parent/guardian to sign up.” ([ftc.gov](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/childrens-online-privacy-protection-rule-six-step-compliance-plan-your-business?utm_source=openai))

**Privacy-page snippet:**
- “We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we learn we’ve received personal information from a child under 13, we will delete it.” ([ftc.gov](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/childrens-online-privacy-protection-rule-six-step-compliance-plan-your-business?utm_source=openai))

### 8) Privacy/data minimization + security (privacy page)
**Data minimization:**
- “We collect only the information needed to provide the worksheet and related updates, and we keep it only as long as necessary.” ([ftc.gov](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/protecting-personal-information-guide-business?utm_source=openai))

**Security (don’t overpromise):**
- “We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect personal information.” ([ftc.gov](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/start-security-guide-business?utm_source=openai))

### 9) Email footer compliance (CAN‑SPAM essentials)
**Opt-out language (no special system required):**
- “To stop receiving emails, reply with ‘unsubscribe’ from the address you used to sign up.” ([ftc.gov](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2019/02/ftc-completes-review-can-spam-rule?utm_source=openai))

**Address line (required for many commercial email scenarios — fill with real address/PO box):**
- “Mailing address: [Your business mailing address or PO box]” ([ftc.gov](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2019/02/ftc-completes-review-can-spam-rule?utm_source=openai))

**Why they’re receiving it (best practice):**
- “You’re receiving this because you requested the Weekly Reset Worksheet.” ([ftc.gov](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2019/02/ftc-completes-review-can-spam-rule?utm_source=openai))
