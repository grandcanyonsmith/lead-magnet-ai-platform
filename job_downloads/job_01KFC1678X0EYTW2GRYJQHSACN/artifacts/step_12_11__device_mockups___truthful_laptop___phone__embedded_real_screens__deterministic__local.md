Mockups could not be generated in this runtime because the required **Step 8/9 screen sources are missing** (no preview PNGs under `/mnt/data/work/build/previews/` and no mobile crop PNGs under `/mnt/data/work/build/mobile_crops/`). Per the hard rules, I did **not** create any mockup PNGs (to avoid blank/non-truthful screens).

Generated report (with searched paths and expected outputs):
