In the upper 78%: execution/follow-through cues: a time-block strip represented by clean rectangular blocks (no words or numbers), a simple timer or phone face shown as abstract shapes only (no readable time, no notifications), and a minimal forward arrow card using iconography only (no text). Include a small 'do not disturb' style icon on a card (icon only, not a brand glyph). Add subtle teal and a small gold accent for cohesion. Minimal, modern, no medical vibes.\\nNegative prompt: text, letters, words, numbers, readable UI, watermark, logo, brand marks, children, faces, medical imagery, neon colors, clutter, cartoon/illustration.\",\n      \"url\": \"https://dmydkyj79auy7.cloudfront.net/cust_84c8e438/jobs/job_01KFC0AQ8QWWJ85QBY6JMHX7K7/smart_home_interface_desk_setup_4.png\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nGenerated Images:\n- https://dmydkyj79auy7.cloudfront.net/cust_84c8e438/jobs/job_01KFC0AQ8QWWJ85QBY6JMHX7K7/chart_folder_and_file_organizer_3.png\n- https://dmydkyj79auy7.cloudfront.net/cust_84c8e438/jobs/job_01KFC0AQ8QWWJ85QBY6JMHX7K7/laptop_and_checklist_on_desk.png\n- https://dmydkyj79auy7.cloudfront.net/cust_84c8e438/jobs/job_01KFC0AQ8QWWJ85QBY6JMHX7K7/smart_home_interface_desk_setup_4.png\n- https://dmydkyj79auy7.cloudfront.net/cust_84c8e438/jobs/job_01KFC0AQ8QWWJ85QBY6JMHX7K7/weekly_checklist_on_desk_2.png\n\n\n=== Step 9: Landing Page HTML (Template-Ready + Webinar Registration Routing) ===\n{\n  \"html_file\": \"landing-page.html\",\n  \"cta_target\": \"{{WEBINAR_REG_URL}}\",\n  \"assets_used\": [\"hero-preview.png\", \"pillar-1.png\", \"pillar-2.png\", \"pillar-3.png\"]\n}\n\n\n=== Step 10: Final Deliverables Manifest + Implementation Notes ===\n{\n  \"deliverables\": {\n    \"images\": [\n      {\n        \"file\": \"hero-preview.png\",\n        \"usage\": \"Hero video preview thumbnail\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"file\": \"pillar-1.png\",\n        \"usage\": \"Pillar 1 card image\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"file\": \"pillar-2.png\",\n        \"usage\": \"Pillar 2 card image\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"file\": \"pillar-3.png\",\n        \"usage\": \"Pillar 3 card image\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"html\": {\n      \"file\": \"landing-page.html\",\n      \"template_id\": \"tmpl_01KC54TZYGA3QNAM68FDBMB9G5\"\n    },\n    \"copy_source\": \"Embedded in funnel-data JSON inside HTML\"\n  },\n  \"implementation\": {\n    \"required_inputs_to_finalize\": [\n      \"Confirm WEBINAR_REG_URL if placeholder\"\n    ],\n    \"routing_notes\": [\n      \"All buttons and hero thumbnail link to webinar registration\"\n    ],\n    \"compliance_notes\": [\n      \"Keep disclaimer visible; avoid promissory claims\"\n    ],\n    \"qa_checklist\": [\n      \"Test mobile layout\",\n      \"Test CTA links\",\n      \"Confirm images load and are crisp\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\ninput: {\n  \"deliverables\": {\n    \"images\": [\n      {\n        \"file\": \"hero-preview.png\",\n        \"usage\": \"Hero video preview thumbnail\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"file\": \"pillar-1.png\",\n        \"usage\": \"Pillar 1 card image\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"file\": \"pillar-2.png\",\n        \"usage\": \"Pillar 2 card image\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"file\": \"pillar-3.png\",\n        \"usage\": \"Pillar 3 card image\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"html\": {\n      \"file\": \"landing-page.html\",\n      \"template_id\": \"tmpl_01KC54TZYGA3QNAM68FDBMB9G5\"\n    },\n    \"copy_source\": \"Embedded in funnel-data JSON inside HTML\"\n  },\n  \"implementation\": {\n    \"required_inputs_to_finalize\": [\n      \"Confirm WEBINAR_REG_URL if placeholder\"\n    ],\n    \"routing_notes\": [\n      \"All buttons and hero thumbnail link to webinar registration\"\n    ],\n    \"compliance_notes\": [\n      \"Keep disclaimer visible; avoid promissory claims\"\n    ],\n    \"qa_checklist\": [\n      \"Test mobile layout\",\n      \"Test CTA links\",\n      \"Confirm images load and are crisp\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n_handoff: {'source_step_index': 10.0, 'source_workflow_id': 'wf_01KC54TZXAPWPQG77K8FJ3SCZ8', 'source_step_name': 'send to capture funnel lead magnet ', 'source_job_id': 'job_01KFC0AQ8QWWJ85QBY6JMHX7K7', 'bypass_required_inputs': True, 'timestamp': '2026-01-19T21:04:48.212937'}\nPhone: (773) 746-5989\nEmail: colleen@thekeycoach.org", "reasoning": {"effort": "medium"}, "service_tier": "priority", "text": {"verbosity": "medium"}}}, "output": "## Execution Contract (Global, No-Interaction Workflow)\n\n### 1) Working Directory + Required Folder Structure\nAll work MUST occur under `/work/` with these relative paths:\n\n```\n/work/\n  canon/     (canonical JSON registries)\n  src/       (structured content JSON)\n  build/     (intermediate outputs)\n  dist/      (final deploy-ready site bundle)\n  dist/assets/  (all deployable static assets)\n```\n\n**Deployment rule:** Only contents of `/work/dist/` are considered deployable.

All must pass.\n\n### 8.1 Canon registry integrity\n- File exists: `/work/canon/canon.json`\n- JSON parses\n- Values match exactly:\n  - `naming.project_slug` equals `the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset`\n  - `file_naming.pdf_filename_standard` equals `the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset_v1.pdf`\n  - `file_naming.pdf_filename_print` equals `the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset_v1_print.pdf`\n  - `utm.storage_key` equals `the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset_attr_v1`\n  - `s3.s3_bucket_name` equals `cc360-pages`\n  - `s3.s3_region` equals `us-west-2`\n  - `s3.s3_prefix` equals `the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/`\n  - `urls.url_landing` equals `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/index.html`\n  - `urls.url_privacy` equals `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/privacy.html`\n  - `urls.url_terms` equals `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/terms.html`\n\n### 8.2 Dist bundle completeness\nAll required files listed in section 1 exist under `/work/dist` and are non-empty (bytes > 0).\n\n### 8.3 No placeholders anywhere (hard)\nAcross all files under `/work/dist` (including emails), a recursive scan must find none of:\n- The substring `{{`\n- The substring `}}`\n- The substring `TODO`\n- The substring `[[`\n- The substring `]]`\n\nBuild fails if any found.\n\n### 8.4 Asset path rule (hard)\nIn every `.html`, `.css`, `.js` under `/work/dist`:\n- No occurrences of `src=\"/assets/` or `href=\"/assets/` or `url(/assets/`\n- All asset references that point to local files begin with `assets/`\n\n### 8.5 PDF locks (hard)\n- Both PDF files exist at the exact required paths.\n- Filenames match canon exactly.\n- Page count is exactly 8 for both.\n- Page size is Letter portrait for both (must be validated via a PDF inspection tool in the build).\n\n### 8.6 Preview + crop truthfulness (hard)\n- Preview PNGs exist exactly as specified.\n- Crops exist exactly as specified.\n- Mockups exist exactly as specified.\n- QA must validate that preview PNGs were generated from the standard PDF by re-rendering the same pages and comparing SHA256 hashes of the resulting preview files. The build process must therefore generate previews only by rendering the PDF (not by rendering source HTML directly).\n\n### 8.7 Email legal links absolute (hard)\nIn every email file under `/work/dist/emails`:\n- Must contain the exact privacy URL:\n  - `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/privacy.html`\n- Must contain the exact terms URL:\n  - `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/terms.html`\n\n### 8.8 No medical claims / no guarantees (hard, automated heuristic + manual spot)\nAutomated heuristic must flag and fail if any of these substrings appear anywhere in `/work/dist`:\n- `cure`\n- `treat`\n- `guarantee`\n- `guaranteed`\n- `will eliminate`\n- `will fix`\n- `medical advice`\n\nManual spot check still required by QA, but automated failure is mandatory if any appear.\n\n### 8.9 S3 upload + HEAD verification (hard)\n- Upload performed to exactly:\n  - `s3://cc360-pages/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/`\n- Region used: `us-west-2`\n- HEAD verification done for the minimum required object list in section 7.3 and all succeeded.\n\n---\n\n## 9) Build Execution Outline (Deterministic, No Prompts)\nThis is the required order of operations:\n\n1. Read and validate `/work/canon/canon.json` against the locked values in section 8.1. Fail fast if mismatch.\n2. Generate the 8-page standard PDF at `/work/dist/assets/pdf/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset_v1.pdf`.\n3. Generate the 8-page print PDF at `/work/dist/assets/pdf/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset_v1_print.pdf`.\n4. Validate both PDFs page count and page size.\n5. Render preview pages (1, 3, 6) from the standard PDF into the required PNGs (1600w and 800w).\n6. Generate mobile crops from the 1600w previews into the required 1080\u00d71350 PNGs.\n7. Generate parallax backgrounds from page 1 preview into the required JPGs.\n8. Generate mockups embedding the exported crops/previews into the required PNGs.\n9. Generate OG image from the cover hero crop into the required JPG.\n10. Generate `index.html`, `thank-you.html`, `privacy.html`, `terms.html` with correct relative asset references.\n11. Generate `assets/css/site.css` and `assets/js/site.js` implementing locked behaviors.\n12. Generate all email files with absolute legal links.\n13. Generate `/work/dist/build.json` with SHA256 hashes for every dist file.\n14. Run all QA gates in section 8 locally. If any fail, stop.\n15. Upload `/work/dist` to S3 prefix.\n16. Run S3 HEAD verification (section 7.3). If any fail, stop.\n\n---\n\n## 10) Deployment URLs (Locked Outputs)\nAfter successful upload, these must be reachable (and must match canon exactly):\n\n- Landing page:  \n  `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/index.html`\n\n- Thank-you page:  \n  `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/thank-you.html`\n\n- Privacy page:  \n  `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/privacy.html`\n\n- Terms page:  \n  `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/terms.html`\n\n---\n\n## 11) Notes on Interpretation (None Allowed)\nWhere this spec says \u201cmust\u201d, later steps must implement exactly.  \nWhere a tool choice is not specified, later steps must still satisfy the outputs and QA gates exactly, but must not change any locked filenames, paths, page counts, crop geometry, or URLs described above.\n\nThis concludes the single-source executable build spec and QA checklist.", "image_urls": [], "response_details": {"image_urls": [], "image_urls_count": 0, "output_text_length": 23627, "has_output_text": true, "response_keys": ["output_text", "image_urls", "usage", "model", "raw_api_response", "artifact_id"]}, "usage_info": {"model": "gpt-5.2", "input_tokens": 1724, "output_tokens": 11597, "total_tokens": 13321, "cost_usd": "0.182575", "service_type": "openai_worker_report"}, "timestamp": "2026-01-19T21:06:03.605390", "duration_ms": 131751, "artifact_id": "art_01KFC1CFN8EZWT6CNFYFNTRKVA"}, {"step_name": "4) Research \u2192 Topic Standards + Safe Language + Red-Flag Guidance", "step_order": 5, "step_type": "ai_generation", "success": true, "model": "gpt-5.2", "input": {"model": "gpt-5.2", "instructions": "Use web_search to collect authoritative sources relevant to the lead magnet topic (guidelines, standards, scope-of-practice, FTC/advertising cautions as relevant).\n\nOutput:\n- A standards table: topic area \u2192 safe phrasing \u2192 what NOT to say \u2192 source URL.\n- A compliance language bank (short disclaimers, scope statements) that can be inserted into PDF/pages/emails.\n\nConstraints:\n- Be conservative.

All must pass.\n\n### 8.1 Canon registry integrity\n- File exists: `/work/canon/canon.json`\n- JSON parses\n- Values match exactly:\n  - `naming.project_slug` equals `the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset`\n  - `file_naming.pdf_filename_standard` equals `the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset_v1.pdf`\n  - `file_naming.pdf_filename_print` equals `the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset_v1_print.pdf`\n  - `utm.storage_key` equals `the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset_attr_v1`\n  - `s3.s3_bucket_name` equals `cc360-pages`\n  - `s3.s3_region` equals `us-west-2`\n  - `s3.s3_prefix` equals `the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/`\n  - `urls.url_landing` equals `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/index.html`\n  - `urls.url_privacy` equals `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/privacy.html`\n  - `urls.url_terms` equals `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/terms.html`\n\n### 8.2 Dist bundle completeness\nAll required files listed in section 1 exist under `/work/dist` and are non-empty (bytes > 0).\n\n### 8.3 No placeholders anywhere (hard)\nAcross all files under `/work/dist` (including emails), a recursive scan must find none of:\n- The substring `{{`\n- The substring `}}`\n- The substring `TODO`\n- The substring `[[`\n- The substring `]]`\n\nBuild fails if any found.\n\n### 8.4 Asset path rule (hard)\nIn every `.html`, `.css`, `.js` under `/work/dist`:\n- No occurrences of `src=\"/assets/` or `href=\"/assets/` or `url(/assets/`\n- All asset references that point to local files begin with `assets/`\n\n### 8.5 PDF locks (hard)\n- Both PDF files exist at the exact required paths.\n- Filenames match canon exactly.\n- Page count is exactly 8 for both.\n- Page size is Letter portrait for both (must be validated via a PDF inspection tool in the build).\n\n### 8.6 Preview + crop truthfulness (hard)\n- Preview PNGs exist exactly as specified.\n- Crops exist exactly as specified.\n- Mockups exist exactly as specified.\n- QA must validate that preview PNGs were generated from the standard PDF by re-rendering the same pages and comparing SHA256 hashes of the resulting preview files. The build process must therefore generate previews only by rendering the PDF (not by rendering source HTML directly).\n\n### 8.7 Email legal links absolute (hard)\nIn every email file under `/work/dist/emails`:\n- Must contain the exact privacy URL:\n  - `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/privacy.html`\n- Must contain the exact terms URL:\n  - `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/terms.html`\n\n### 8.8 No medical claims / no guarantees (hard, automated heuristic + manual spot)\nAutomated heuristic must flag and fail if any of these substrings appear anywhere in `/work/dist`:\n- `cure`\n- `treat`\n- `guarantee`\n- `guaranteed`\n- `will eliminate`\n- `will fix`\n- `medical advice`\n\nManual spot check still required by QA, but automated failure is mandatory if any appear.\n\n### 8.9 S3 upload + HEAD verification (hard)\n- Upload performed to exactly:\n  - `s3://cc360-pages/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/`\n- Region used: `us-west-2`\n- HEAD verification done for the minimum required object list in section 7.3 and all succeeded.\n\n---\n\n## 9) Build Execution Outline (Deterministic, No Prompts)\nThis is the required order of operations:\n\n1. Read and validate `/work/canon/canon.json` against the locked values in section 8.1. Fail fast if mismatch.\n2. Generate the 8-page standard PDF at `/work/dist/assets/pdf/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset_v1.pdf`.\n3. Generate the 8-page print PDF at `/work/dist/assets/pdf/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset_v1_print.pdf`.\n4. Validate both PDFs page count and page size.\n5. Render preview pages (1, 3, 6) from the standard PDF into the required PNGs (1600w and 800w).\n6. Generate mobile crops from the 1600w previews into the required 1080\u00d71350 PNGs.\n7. Generate parallax backgrounds from page 1 preview into the required JPGs.\n8. Generate mockups embedding the exported crops/previews into the required PNGs.\n9. Generate OG image from the cover hero crop into the required JPG.\n10. Generate `index.html`, `thank-you.html`, `privacy.html`, `terms.html` with correct relative asset references.\n11. Generate `assets/css/site.css` and `assets/js/site.js` implementing locked behaviors.\n12. Generate all email files with absolute legal links.\n13. Generate `/work/dist/build.json` with SHA256 hashes for every dist file.\n14. Run all QA gates in section 8 locally. If any fail, stop.\n15. Upload `/work/dist` to S3 prefix.\n16. Run S3 HEAD verification (section 7.3). If any fail, stop.\n\n---\n\n## 10) Deployment URLs (Locked Outputs)\nAfter successful upload, these must be reachable (and must match canon exactly):\n\n- Landing page:  \n  `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/index.html`\n\n- Thank-you page:  \n  `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/thank-you.html`\n\n- Privacy page:  \n  `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/privacy.html`\n\n- Terms page:  \n  `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/terms.html`\n\n---\n\n## 11) Notes on Interpretation (None Allowed)\nWhere this spec says \u201cmust\u201d, later steps must implement exactly.  \nWhere a tool choice is not specified, later steps must still satisfy the outputs and QA gates exactly, but must not change any locked filenames, paths, page counts, crop geometry, or URLs described above.\n\nThis concludes the single-source executable build spec and QA checklist.\n\n--- Current Step Context ---\n", "previous_context": "\n=== Step 3: 2) Canonical Registry \u2192 Names, URLs, Paths, UTM Schema, Legal Link Canon, S3 Deployment Targets ===\n```json\n{\n  \"meta\": {\n    \"schema_name\": \"cc360_canon\",\n    \"schema_version\": \"1.0\",\n    \"generated_at_iso\": \"2026-01-19T00:00:00Z\",\n    \"runtime_date_yyyymmdd\": \"20260119\",\n    \"single_source_of_truth_path\": \"/work/canon/canon.json\"\n  },\n  \"naming\": {\n    \"project_slug\": \"the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset\",\n    \"lead_magnet_primary_name\": \"Weekly Reset Worksheet\",\n    \"subtitle\": \"A 30-minute workflow to track deadlines, reduce missing work, and lower homework conflict\",\n    \"short_name\": \"Weekly Reset\"\n  },\n  \"file_naming\": {\n    \"pdf_filename_standard\": \"the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset_v1.pdf\",\n    \"pdf_filename_print\": \"the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset_v1_print.pdf\",\n    \"rules\": {\n      \"pdf_filename_standard_rule\": \"pdf_filename_standard must equal project_slug + '_v1.pdf'\",\n      \"pdf_filename_print_rule\": \"pdf_filename_print must equal project_slug + '_v1_print.pdf'\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"dist\": {\n    \"dist_index_html\": \"index.html\",\n    \"dist_thankyou_html\": \"thank-you.html\",\n    \"dist_privacy_html\": \"privacy.html\",\n    \"dist_terms_html\": \"terms.html\",\n    \"dist_assets_dir\": \"assets/\",\n    \"rules\": {\n      \"deployable_root_rule\": \"Only files under /work/dist/ are deployable\",\n      \"asset_path_rule\": \"All referenced assets (images, CSS, JS, PDFs) must live under /work/dist/assets/ and be referenced as 'assets/...'

Read and validate `/work/canon/canon.json` against the locked values in section 8.1. Fail fast if mismatch.\n2. Generate the 8-page standard PDF at `/work/dist/assets/pdf/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset_v1.pdf`.\n3. Generate the 8-page print PDF at `/work/dist/assets/pdf/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset_v1_print.pdf`.\n4. Validate both PDFs page count and page size.\n5. Render preview pages (1, 3, 6) from the standard PDF into the required PNGs (1600w and 800w).\n6. Generate mobile crops from the 1600w previews into the required 1080\u00d71350 PNGs.\n7. Generate parallax backgrounds from page 1 preview into the required JPGs.\n8. Generate mockups embedding the exported crops/previews into the required PNGs.\n9. Generate OG image from the cover hero crop into the required JPG.\n10. Generate `index.html`, `thank-you.html`, `privacy.html`, `terms.html` with correct relative asset references.\n11. Generate `assets/css/site.css` and `assets/js/site.js` implementing locked behaviors.\n12. Generate all email files with absolute legal links.\n13. Generate `/work/dist/build.json` with SHA256 hashes for every dist file.\n14. Run all QA gates in section 8 locally. If any fail, stop.\n15. Upload `/work/dist` to S3 prefix.\n16. Run S3 HEAD verification (section 7.3). If any fail, stop.\n\n---\n\n## 10) Deployment URLs (Locked Outputs)\nAfter successful upload, these must be reachable (and must match canon exactly):\n\n- Landing page:  \n  `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/index.html`\n\n- Thank-you page:  \n  `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/thank-you.html`\n\n- Privacy page:  \n  `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/privacy.html`\n\n- Terms page:  \n  `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/terms.html`\n\n---\n\n## 11) Notes on Interpretation (None Allowed)\nWhere this spec says \u201cmust\u201d, later steps must implement exactly.  \nWhere a tool choice is not specified, later steps must still satisfy the outputs and QA gates exactly, but must not change any locked filenames, paths, page counts, crop geometry, or URLs described above.\n\nThis concludes the single-source executable build spec and QA checklist.", "context": "", "tools": [{"type": "web_search"}], "tool_choice": "required", "raw_api_request": {"model": "gpt-5.2", "instructions": "IMPORTANT: This workflow runs end-to-end with NO user interaction between steps.

All must pass.\n\n### 8.1 Canon registry integrity\n- File exists: `/work/canon/canon.json`\n- JSON parses\n- Values match exactly:\n  - `naming.project_slug` equals `the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset`\n  - `file_naming.pdf_filename_standard` equals `the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset_v1.pdf`\n  - `file_naming.pdf_filename_print` equals `the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset_v1_print.pdf`\n  - `utm.storage_key` equals `the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset_attr_v1`\n  - `s3.s3_bucket_name` equals `cc360-pages`\n  - `s3.s3_region` equals `us-west-2`\n  - `s3.s3_prefix` equals `the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/`\n  - `urls.url_landing` equals `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/index.html`\n  - `urls.url_privacy` equals `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/privacy.html`\n  - `urls.url_terms` equals `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/terms.html`\n\n### 8.2 Dist bundle completeness\nAll required files listed in section 1 exist under `/work/dist` and are non-empty (bytes > 0).\n\n### 8.3 No placeholders anywhere (hard)\nAcross all files under `/work/dist` (including emails), a recursive scan must find none of:\n- The substring `{{`\n- The substring `}}`\n- The substring `TODO`\n- The substring `[[`\n- The substring `]]`\n\nBuild fails if any found.\n\n### 8.4 Asset path rule (hard)\nIn every `.html`, `.css`, `.js` under `/work/dist`:\n- No occurrences of `src=\"/assets/` or `href=\"/assets/` or `url(/assets/`\n- All asset references that point to local files begin with `assets/`\n\n### 8.5 PDF locks (hard)\n- Both PDF files exist at the exact required paths.\n- Filenames match canon exactly.\n- Page count is exactly 8 for both.\n- Page size is Letter portrait for both (must be validated via a PDF inspection tool in the build).\n\n### 8.6 Preview + crop truthfulness (hard)\n- Preview PNGs exist exactly as specified.\n- Crops exist exactly as specified.\n- Mockups exist exactly as specified.\n- QA must validate that preview PNGs were generated from the standard PDF by re-rendering the same pages and comparing SHA256 hashes of the resulting preview files. The build process must therefore generate previews only by rendering the PDF (not by rendering source HTML directly).\n\n### 8.7 Email legal links absolute (hard)\nIn every email file under `/work/dist/emails`:\n- Must contain the exact privacy URL:\n  - `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/privacy.html`\n- Must contain the exact terms URL:\n  - `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/terms.html`\n\n### 8.8 No medical claims / no guarantees (hard, automated heuristic + manual spot)\nAutomated heuristic must flag and fail if any of these substrings appear anywhere in `/work/dist`:\n- `cure`\n- `treat`\n- `guarantee`\n- `guaranteed`\n- `will eliminate`\n- `will fix`\n- `medical advice`\n\nManual spot check still required by QA, but automated failure is mandatory if any appear.\n\n### 8.9 S3 upload + HEAD verification (hard)\n- Upload performed to exactly:\n  - `s3://cc360-pages/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/`\n- Region used: `us-west-2`\n- HEAD verification done for the minimum required object list in section 7.3 and all succeeded.\n\n---\n\n## 9) Build Execution Outline (Deterministic, No Prompts)\nThis is the required order of operations:\n\n1. Read and validate `/work/canon/canon.json` against the locked values in section 8.1. Fail fast if mismatch.\n2. Generate the 8-page standard PDF at `/work/dist/assets/pdf/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset_v1.pdf`.\n3. Generate the 8-page print PDF at `/work/dist/assets/pdf/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset_v1_print.pdf`.\n4. Validate both PDFs page count and page size.\n5. Render preview pages (1, 3, 6) from the standard PDF into the required PNGs (1600w and 800w).\n6. Generate mobile crops from the 1600w previews into the required 1080\u00d71350 PNGs.\n7. Generate parallax backgrounds from page 1 preview into the required JPGs.\n8. Generate mockups embedding the exported crops/previews into the required PNGs.\n9. Generate OG image from the cover hero crop into the required JPG.\n10. Generate `index.html`, `thank-you.html`, `privacy.html`, `terms.html` with correct relative asset references.\n11. Generate `assets/css/site.css` and `assets/js/site.js` implementing locked behaviors.\n12. Generate all email files with absolute legal links.\n13. Generate `/work/dist/build.json` with SHA256 hashes for every dist file.\n14. Run all QA gates in section 8 locally. If any fail, stop.\n15. Upload `/work/dist` to S3 prefix.\n16. Run S3 HEAD verification (section 7.3). If any fail, stop.\n\n---\n\n## 10) Deployment URLs (Locked Outputs)\nAfter successful upload, these must be reachable (and must match canon exactly):\n\n- Landing page:  \n  `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/index.html`\n\n- Thank-you page:  \n  `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/thank-you.html`\n\n- Privacy page:  \n  `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/privacy.html`\n\n- Terms page:  \n  `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/terms.html`\n\n---\n\n## 11) Notes on Interpretation (None Allowed)\nWhere this spec says \u201cmust\u201d, later steps must implement exactly.  \nWhere a tool choice is not specified, later steps must still satisfy the outputs and QA gates exactly, but must not change any locked filenames, paths, page counts, crop geometry, or URLs described above.\n\nThis concludes the single-source executable build spec and QA checklist.\n\n--- Current Step Context ---\n", "tools":

All must pass.\n\n### 8.1 Canon registry integrity\n- File exists: `/work/canon/canon.json`\n- JSON parses\n- Values match exactly:\n  - `naming.project_slug` equals `the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset`\n  - `file_naming.pdf_filename_standard` equals `the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset_v1.pdf`\n  - `file_naming.pdf_filename_print` equals `the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset_v1_print.pdf`\n  - `utm.storage_key` equals `the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset_attr_v1`\n  - `s3.s3_bucket_name` equals `cc360-pages`\n  - `s3.s3_region` equals `us-west-2`\n  - `s3.s3_prefix` equals `the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/`\n  - `urls.url_landing` equals `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/index.html`\n  - `urls.url_privacy` equals `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/privacy.html`\n  - `urls.url_terms` equals `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/terms.html`\n\n### 8.2 Dist bundle completeness\nAll required files listed in section 1 exist under `/work/dist` and are non-empty (bytes > 0).\n\n### 8.3 No placeholders anywhere (hard)\nAcross all files under `/work/dist` (including emails), a recursive scan must find none of:\n- The substring `{{`\n- The substring `}}`\n- The substring `TODO`\n- The substring `[[`\n- The substring `]]`\n\nBuild fails if any found.\n\n### 8.4 Asset path rule (hard)\nIn every `.html`, `.css`, `.js` under `/work/dist`:\n- No occurrences of `src=\"/assets/` or `href=\"/assets/` or `url(/assets/`\n- All asset references that point to local files begin with `assets/`\n\n### 8.5 PDF locks (hard)\n- Both PDF files exist at the exact required paths.\n- Filenames match canon exactly.\n- Page count is exactly 8 for both.\n- Page size is Letter portrait for both (must be validated via a PDF inspection tool in the build).\n\n### 8.6 Preview + crop truthfulness (hard)\n- Preview PNGs exist exactly as specified.\n- Crops exist exactly as specified.\n- Mockups exist exactly as specified.\n- QA must validate that preview PNGs were generated from the standard PDF by re-rendering the same pages and comparing SHA256 hashes of the resulting preview files. The build process must therefore generate previews only by rendering the PDF (not by rendering source HTML directly).\n\n### 8.7 Email legal links absolute (hard)\nIn every email file under `/work/dist/emails`:\n- Must contain the exact privacy URL:\n  - `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/privacy.html`\n- Must contain the exact terms URL:\n  - `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/terms.html`\n\n### 8.8 No medical claims / no guarantees (hard, automated heuristic + manual spot)\nAutomated heuristic must flag and fail if any of these substrings appear anywhere in `/work/dist`:\n- `cure`\n- `treat`\n- `guarantee`\n- `guaranteed`\n- `will eliminate`\n- `will fix`\n- `medical advice`\n\nManual spot check still required by QA, but automated failure is mandatory if any appear.\n\n### 8.9 S3 upload + HEAD verification (hard)\n- Upload performed to exactly:\n  - `s3://cc360-pages/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/`\n- Region used: `us-west-2`\n- HEAD verification done for the minimum required object list in section 7.3 and all succeeded.\n\n---\n\n## 9) Build Execution Outline (Deterministic, No Prompts)\nThis is the required order of operations:\n\n1. Read and validate `/work/canon/canon.json` against the locked values in section 8.1. Fail fast if mismatch.\n2. Generate the 8-page standard PDF at `/work/dist/assets/pdf/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset_v1.pdf`.\n3. Generate the 8-page print PDF at `/work/dist/assets/pdf/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset_v1_print.pdf`.\n4. Validate both PDFs page count and page size.\n5. Render preview pages (1, 3, 6) from the standard PDF into the required PNGs (1600w and 800w).\n6. Generate mobile crops from the 1600w previews into the required 1080\u00d71350 PNGs.\n7. Generate parallax backgrounds from page 1 preview into the required JPGs.\n8. Generate mockups embedding the exported crops/previews into the required PNGs.\n9. Generate OG image from the cover hero crop into the required JPG.\n10. Generate `index.html`, `thank-you.html`, `privacy.html`, `terms.html` with correct relative asset references.\n11. Generate `assets/css/site.css` and `assets/js/site.js` implementing locked behaviors.\n12. Generate all email files with absolute legal links.\n13. Generate `/work/dist/build.json` with SHA256 hashes for every dist file.\n14. Run all QA gates in section 8 locally. If any fail, stop.\n15. Upload `/work/dist` to S3 prefix.\n16. Run S3 HEAD verification (section 7.3). If any fail, stop.\n\n---\n\n## 10) Deployment URLs (Locked Outputs)\nAfter successful upload, these must be reachable (and must match canon exactly):\n\n- Landing page:  \n  `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/index.html`\n\n- Thank-you page:  \n  `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/thank-you.html`\n\n- Privacy page:  \n  `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/privacy.html`\n\n- Terms page:  \n  `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/terms.html`\n\n---\n\n## 11) Notes on Interpretation (None Allowed)\nWhere this spec says \u201cmust\u201d, later steps must implement exactly.  \nWhere a tool choice is not specified, later steps must still satisfy the outputs and QA gates exactly, but must not change any locked filenames, paths, page counts, crop geometry, or URLs described above.\n\nThis concludes the single-source executable build spec and QA checklist.\n\n\n=== Step 5: 4) Research \u2192 Topic Standards +

All must pass.\n\n### 8.1 Canon registry integrity\n- File exists: `/work/canon/canon.json`\n- JSON parses\n- Values match exactly:\n  - `naming.project_slug` equals `the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset`\n  - `file_naming.pdf_filename_standard` equals `the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset_v1.pdf`\n  - `file_naming.pdf_filename_print` equals `the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset_v1_print.pdf`\n  - `utm.storage_key` equals `the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset_attr_v1`\n  - `s3.s3_bucket_name` equals `cc360-pages`\n  - `s3.s3_region` equals `us-west-2`\n  - `s3.s3_prefix` equals `the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/`\n  - `urls.url_landing` equals `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/index.html`\n  - `urls.url_privacy` equals `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/privacy.html`\n  - `urls.url_terms` equals `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/terms.html`\n\n### 8.2 Dist bundle completeness\nAll required files listed in section 1 exist under `/work/dist` and are non-empty (bytes > 0).\n\n### 8.3 No placeholders anywhere (hard)\nAcross all files under `/work/dist` (including emails), a recursive scan must find none of:\n- The substring `{{`\n- The substring `}}`\n- The substring `TODO`\n- The substring `[[`\n- The substring `]]`\n\nBuild fails if any found.\n\n### 8.4 Asset path rule (hard)\nIn every `.html`, `.css`, `.js` under `/work/dist`:\n- No occurrences of `src=\"/assets/` or `href=\"/assets/` or `url(/assets/`\n- All asset references that point to local files begin with `assets/`\n\n### 8.5 PDF locks (hard)\n- Both PDF files exist at the exact required paths.\n- Filenames match canon exactly.\n- Page count is exactly 8 for both.\n- Page size is Letter portrait for both (must be validated via a PDF inspection tool in the build).\n\n### 8.6 Preview + crop truthfulness (hard)\n- Preview PNGs exist exactly as specified.\n- Crops exist exactly as specified.\n- Mockups exist exactly as specified.\n- QA must validate that preview PNGs were generated from the standard PDF by re-rendering the same pages and comparing SHA256 hashes of the resulting preview files. The build process must therefore generate previews only by rendering the PDF (not by rendering source HTML directly).\n\n### 8.7 Email legal links absolute (hard)\nIn every email file under `/work/dist/emails`:\n- Must contain the exact privacy URL:\n  - `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/privacy.html`\n- Must contain the exact terms URL:\n  - `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/terms.html`\n\n### 8.8 No medical claims / no guarantees (hard, automated heuristic + manual spot)\nAutomated heuristic must flag and fail if any of these substrings appear anywhere in `/work/dist`:\n- `cure`\n- `treat`\n- `guarantee`\n- `guaranteed`\n- `will eliminate`\n- `will fix`\n- `medical advice`\n\nManual spot check still required by QA, but automated failure is mandatory if any appear.\n\n### 8.9 S3 upload + HEAD verification (hard)\n- Upload performed to exactly:\n  - `s3://cc360-pages/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/`\n- Region used: `us-west-2`\n- HEAD verification done for the minimum required object list in section 7.3 and all succeeded.\n\n---\n\n## 9) Build Execution Outline (Deterministic, No Prompts)\nThis is the required order of operations:\n\n1. Read and validate `/work/canon/canon.json` against the locked values in section 8.1. Fail fast if mismatch.\n2. Generate the 8-page standard PDF at `/work/dist/assets/pdf/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset_v1.pdf`.\n3. Generate the 8-page print PDF at `/work/dist/assets/pdf/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset_v1_print.pdf`.\n4. Validate both PDFs page count and page size.\n5. Render preview pages (1, 3, 6) from the standard PDF into the required PNGs (1600w and 800w).\n6. Generate mobile crops from the 1600w previews into the required 1080\u00d71350 PNGs.\n7. Generate parallax backgrounds from page 1 preview into the required JPGs.\n8. Generate mockups embedding the exported crops/previews into the required PNGs.\n9. Generate OG image from the cover hero crop into the required JPG.\n10. Generate `index.html`, `thank-you.html`, `privacy.html`, `terms.html` with correct relative asset references.\n11. Generate `assets/css/site.css` and `assets/js/site.js` implementing locked behaviors.\n12. Generate all email files with absolute legal links.\n13. Generate `/work/dist/build.json` with SHA256 hashes for every dist file.\n14. Run all QA gates in section 8 locally. If any fail, stop.\n15. Upload `/work/dist` to S3 prefix.\n16. Run S3 HEAD verification (section 7.3). If any fail, stop.\n\n---\n\n## 10) Deployment URLs (Locked Outputs)\nAfter successful upload, these must be reachable (and must match canon exactly):\n\n- Landing page:  \n  `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/index.html`\n\n- Thank-you page:  \n  `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/thank-you.html`\n\n- Privacy page:  \n  `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/privacy.html`\n\n- Terms page:  \n  `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/terms.html`\n\n---\n\n## 11) Notes on Interpretation (None Allowed)\nWhere this spec says \u201cmust\u201d, later steps must implement exactly.  \nWhere a tool choice is not specified, later steps must still satisfy the outputs and QA gates exactly, but must not change any locked filenames, paths, page counts, crop geometry, or URLs described above.\n\nThis concludes the single-source executable build spec and QA checklist.\n\n\n=== Step 5: 4) Research \u2192 Topic Standards +

Read and validate `/work/canon/canon.json` against the locked values in section 8.1. Fail fast if mismatch.\n2. Generate the 8-page standard PDF at `/work/dist/assets/pdf/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset_v1.pdf`.\n3. Generate the 8-page print PDF at `/work/dist/assets/pdf/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset_v1_print.pdf`.\n4. Validate both PDFs page count and page size.\n5. Render preview pages (1, 3, 6) from the standard PDF into the required PNGs (1600w and 800w).\n6. Generate mobile crops from the 1600w previews into the required 1080\u00d71350 PNGs.\n7. Generate parallax backgrounds from page 1 preview into the required JPGs.\n8. Generate mockups embedding the exported crops/previews into the required PNGs.\n9. Generate OG image from the cover hero crop into the required JPG.\n10. Generate `index.html`, `thank-you.html`, `privacy.html`, `terms.html` with correct relative asset references.\n11. Generate `assets/css/site.css` and `assets/js/site.js` implementing locked behaviors.\n12. Generate all email files with absolute legal links.\n13. Generate `/work/dist/build.json` with SHA256 hashes for every dist file.\n14. Run all QA gates in section 8 locally. If any fail, stop.\n15. Upload `/work/dist` to S3 prefix.\n16. Run S3 HEAD verification (section 7.3). If any fail, stop.\n\n---\n\n## 10) Deployment URLs (Locked Outputs)\nAfter successful upload, these must be reachable (and must match canon exactly):\n\n- Landing page:  \n  `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/index.html`\n\n- Thank-you page:  \n

`https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/terms.html`\n\n---\n\n## 11) Notes on Interpretation (None Allowed)\nWhere this spec says \u201cmust\u201d, later steps must implement exactly.  \nWhere a tool choice is not specified, later steps must still satisfy the outputs and QA gates exactly, but must not change any locked filenames, paths, page counts, crop geometry, or URLs described above.\n\nThis concludes the single-source executable build spec and QA checklist.\n\n\n=== Step 5: 4) Research \u2192 Topic Standards +

authoritative registry for names, filenames, dist bundle contract, attribution persistence, and deployment URLs.\n- All generators/build steps must **read** (not rewrite) this file to:\n  - Name the PDFs exactly as `file_naming.pdf_filename_standard` and `file_naming.pdf_filename_print`.\n  - Create the dist HTML files exactly as listed in `dist.*_html`.\n  - Reference assets with prefix-safe paths using `dist.dist_assets_dir` (i.e., `assets/...`).\n  - Persist/restore attribution using `utm.storage_key` and `utm.persistence_days`.\n  - Build absolute legal links in emails from `urls.url_privacy` and `urls.url_terms`.\n  - Deploy to S3 using `s3.s3_bucket_name`, `s3.s3_region`, and `s3.s3_prefix`, and verify public access using `urls.url_landing` and at least one `assets/...` URL under `s3.public_base_url`.\n- Any string listed in `string_invariants` must be copied **verbatim** wherever it appears across PDFs, pages, and emails (no punctuation/spacing/case changes).\n\n\n=== Step 7: 6) Create Lead Magnet \u2192 Scorecard Content + Scoring Logic + Next-Step Plan (Structured) ===\n```json\n{\n  \"meta\": {\n    \"schema_name\":

All must pass.\n\n### 8.1 Canon registry integrity\n- File exists: `/work/canon/canon.json`\n- JSON parses\n- Values match exactly:\n  - `naming.project_slug` equals `the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset`\n  - `file_naming.pdf_filename_standard` equals `the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset_v1.pdf`\n  - `file_naming.pdf_filename_print` equals `the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset_v1_print.pdf`\n  - `utm.storage_key` equals `the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset_attr_v1`\n  - `s3.s3_bucket_name` equals `cc360-pages`\n  - `s3.s3_region` equals `us-west-2`\n  - `s3.s3_prefix` equals `the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/`\n  - `urls.url_landing` equals `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/index.html`\n  - `urls.url_privacy` equals `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/privacy.html`\n  - `urls.url_terms` equals `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/terms.html`\n\n### 8.2 Dist bundle completeness\nAll required files listed in section 1 exist under `/work/dist` and are non-empty (bytes > 0).\n\n### 8.3 No placeholders anywhere (hard)\nAcross all files under `/work/dist` (including emails), a recursive scan must find none of:\n- The substring `{{`\n- The substring `}}`\n- The substring `TODO`\n- The substring `[[`\n- The substring `]]`\n\nBuild fails if any found.\n\n### 8.4 Asset path rule (hard)\nIn every `.html`, `.css`, `.js` under `/work/dist`:\n- No occurrences of `src=\"/assets/` or `href=\"/assets/` or `url(/assets/`\n- All asset references that point to local files begin with `assets/`\n\n### 8.5 PDF locks (hard)\n- Both PDF files exist at the exact required paths.\n- Filenames match canon exactly.\n- Page count is exactly 8 for both.\n- Page size is Letter portrait for both (must be validated via a PDF inspection tool in the build).\n\n### 8.6 Preview + crop truthfulness (hard)\n- Preview PNGs exist exactly as specified.\n- Crops exist exactly as specified.\n- Mockups exist exactly as specified.\n- QA must validate that preview PNGs were generated from the standard PDF by re-rendering the same pages and comparing SHA256 hashes of the resulting preview files. The build process must therefore generate previews only by rendering the PDF (not by rendering source HTML directly).\n\n### 8.7 Email legal links absolute (hard)\nIn every email file under `/work/dist/emails`:\n- Must contain the exact privacy URL:\n  - `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/privacy.html`\n- Must contain the exact terms URL:\n  - `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/terms.html`\n\n### 8.8 No medical claims / no guarantees (hard, automated heuristic + manual spot)\nAutomated heuristic must flag and fail if any of these substrings appear anywhere in `/work/dist`:\n- `cure`\n- `treat`\n- `guarantee`\n- `guaranteed`\n- `will eliminate`\n- `will fix`\n- `medical advice`\n\nManual spot check still required by QA, but automated failure is mandatory if any appear.\n\n### 8.9 S3 upload + HEAD verification (hard)\n- Upload performed to exactly:\n  - `s3://cc360-pages/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/`\n- Region used: `us-west-2`\n- HEAD verification done for the minimum required object list in section 7.3 and all succeeded.\n\n---\n\n## 9) Build Execution Outline (Deterministic, No Prompts)\nThis is the required order of operations:\n\n1. Read and validate `/work/canon/canon.json` against the locked values in section 8.1. Fail fast if mismatch.\n2. Generate the 8-page standard PDF at `/work/dist/assets/pdf/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset_v1.pdf`.\n3. Generate the 8-page print PDF at `/work/dist/assets/pdf/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset_v1_print.pdf`.\n4. Validate both PDFs page count and page size.\n5. Render preview pages (1, 3, 6) from the standard PDF into the required PNGs (1600w and 800w).\n6. Generate mobile crops from the 1600w previews into the required 1080\u00d71350 PNGs.\n7. Generate parallax backgrounds from page 1 preview into the required JPGs.\n8. Generate mockups embedding the exported crops/previews into the required PNGs.\n9. Generate OG image from the cover hero crop into the required JPG.\n10. Generate `index.html`, `thank-you.html`, `privacy.html`, `terms.html` with correct relative asset references.\n11. Generate `assets/css/site.css` and `assets/js/site.js` implementing locked behaviors.\n12. Generate all email files with absolute legal links.\n13. Generate `/work/dist/build.json` with SHA256 hashes for every dist file.\n14. Run all QA gates in section 8 locally. If any fail, stop.\n15. Upload `/work/dist` to S3 prefix.\n16. Run S3 HEAD verification (section 7.3). If any fail, stop.\n\n---\n\n## 10) Deployment URLs (Locked Outputs)\nAfter successful upload, these must be reachable (and must match canon exactly):\n\n- Landing page:  \n  `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/index.html`\n\n- Thank-you page:  \n  `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/thank-you.html`\n\n- Privacy page:  \n  `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/privacy.html`\n\n- Terms page:  \n  `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/terms.html`\n\n---\n\n## 11) Notes on Interpretation (None Allowed)\nWhere this spec says \u201cmust\u201d, later steps must implement exactly.  \nWhere a tool choice is not specified, later steps must still satisfy the outputs and QA gates exactly, but must not change any locked filenames, paths, page counts, crop geometry, or URLs described above.\n\nThis concludes the single-source executable build spec and QA checklist.\n\n--- Current Step Context ---\n", "previous_context": "\n=== Step 3: 2) Canonical Registry \u2192 Names, URLs, Paths, UTM Schema, Legal Link Canon, S3 Deployment Targets ===\n```json\n{\n  \"meta\": {\n    \"schema_name\": \"cc360_canon\",\n    \"schema_version\": \"1.0\",\n    \"generated_at_iso\": \"2026-01-19T00:00:00Z\",\n    \"runtime_date_yyyymmdd\": \"20260119\",\n    \"single_source_of_truth_path\": \"/work/canon/canon.json\"\n  },\n  \"naming\": {\n    \"project_slug\": \"the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset\",\n    \"lead_magnet_primary_name\": \"Weekly Reset Worksheet\",\n    \"subtitle\": \"A 30-minute workflow to track deadlines, reduce missing work, and lower homework conflict\",\n    \"short_name\": \"Weekly Reset\"\n  },\n  \"file_naming\": {\n    \"pdf_filename_standard\": \"the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset_v1.pdf\",\n    \"pdf_filename_print\": \"the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset_v1_print.pdf\",\n    \"rules\": {\n      \"pdf_filename_standard_rule\": \"pdf_filename_standard must equal project_slug + '_v1.pdf'\",\n      \"pdf_filename_print_rule\": \"pdf_filename_print must equal project_slug + '_v1_print.pdf'\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"dist\": {\n    \"dist_index_html\": \"index.html\",\n    \"dist_thankyou_html\": \"thank-you.html\",\n    \"dist_privacy_html\": \"privacy.html\",\n    \"dist_terms_html\": \"terms.html\",\n    \"dist_assets_dir\": \"assets/\",\n    \"rules\": {\n      \"deployable_root_rule\": \"Only files under /work/dist/ are deployable\",\n      \"asset_path_rule\": \"All referenced assets (images, CSS, JS, PDFs) must live under /work/dist/assets/ and be referenced as 'assets/...'

Generate the 8-page standard PDF at `/work/dist/assets/pdf/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset_v1.pdf`.\n3. Generate the 8-page print PDF at `/work/dist/assets/pdf/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset_v1_print.pdf`.\n4. Validate both PDFs page count and page size.\n5. Render preview pages (1, 3, 6) from the standard PDF into the required PNGs (1600w and 800w).\n6. Generate mobile crops from the 1600w previews into the required 1080\u00d71350 PNGs.\n7. Generate parallax backgrounds from page 1 preview into the required JPGs.\n8. Generate mockups embedding the exported crops/previews into the required PNGs.\n9. Generate OG image from the cover hero crop into the required JPG.\n10. Generate `index.html`, `thank-you.html`, `privacy.html`, `terms.html` with correct relative asset references.\n11. Generate `assets/css/site.css` and `assets/js/site.js` implementing locked behaviors.\n12. Generate all email files with absolute legal links.\n13. Generate `/work/dist/build.json` with SHA256 hashes for every dist file.\n14. Run all QA gates in section 8 locally. If any fail, stop.\n15. Upload `/work/dist` to S3 prefix.\n16. Run S3 HEAD verification (section 7.3). If any fail, stop.\n\n---\n\n## 10) Deployment URLs (Locked Outputs)\nAfter successful upload, these must be reachable (and must match canon exactly):\n\n- Landing page:  \n  `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/index.html`\n\n- Thank-you page:  \n  `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/thank-you.html`\n\n- Privacy page:  \n  `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/privacy.html`\n\n- Terms page:  \n  `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/terms.html`\n\n---\n\n## 11) Notes on Interpretation (None Allowed)\nWhere this spec says \u201cmust\u201d, later steps must implement exactly.  \nWhere a tool choice is not specified, later steps must still satisfy the outputs and QA gates exactly, but must not change any locked filenames, paths, page counts, crop geometry, or URLs described above.\n\nThis concludes the single-source executable build spec and QA checklist.", "context": "", "tools": [{"type": "code_interpreter", "container": {"type": "auto"}}], "tool_choice": "required", "raw_api_request": {"model": "gpt-5.2", "instructions": "IMPORTANT: This workflow runs end-to-end with NO user interaction between steps.

All must pass.\n\n### 8.1 Canon registry integrity\n- File exists: `/work/canon/canon.json`\n- JSON parses\n- Values match exactly:\n  - `naming.project_slug` equals `the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset`\n  - `file_naming.pdf_filename_standard` equals `the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset_v1.pdf`\n  - `file_naming.pdf_filename_print` equals `the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset_v1_print.pdf`\n  - `utm.storage_key` equals `the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset_attr_v1`\n  - `s3.s3_bucket_name` equals `cc360-pages`\n  - `s3.s3_region` equals `us-west-2`\n  - `s3.s3_prefix` equals `the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/`\n  - `urls.url_landing` equals `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/index.html`\n  - `urls.url_privacy` equals `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/privacy.html`\n  - `urls.url_terms` equals `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/terms.html`\n\n### 8.2 Dist bundle completeness\nAll required files listed in section 1 exist under `/work/dist` and are non-empty (bytes > 0).\n\n### 8.3 No placeholders anywhere (hard)\nAcross all files under `/work/dist` (including emails), a recursive scan must find none of:\n- The substring `{{`\n- The substring `}}`\n- The substring `TODO`\n- The substring `[[`\n- The substring `]]`\n\nBuild fails if any found.\n\n### 8.4 Asset path rule (hard)\nIn every `.html`, `.css`, `.js` under `/work/dist`:\n- No occurrences of `src=\"/assets/` or `href=\"/assets/` or `url(/assets/`\n- All asset references that point to local files begin with `assets/`\n\n### 8.5 PDF locks (hard)\n- Both PDF files exist at the exact required paths.\n- Filenames match canon exactly.\n- Page count is exactly 8 for both.\n- Page size is Letter portrait for both (must be validated via a PDF inspection tool in the build).\n\n### 8.6 Preview + crop truthfulness (hard)\n- Preview PNGs exist exactly as specified.\n- Crops exist exactly as specified.\n- Mockups exist exactly as specified.\n- QA must validate that preview PNGs were generated from the standard PDF by re-rendering the same pages and comparing SHA256 hashes of the resulting preview files. The build process must therefore generate previews only by rendering the PDF (not by rendering source HTML directly).\n\n### 8.7 Email legal links absolute (hard)\nIn every email file under `/work/dist/emails`:\n- Must contain the exact privacy URL:\n  - `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/privacy.html`\n- Must contain the exact terms URL:\n  - `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/terms.html`\n\n### 8.8 No medical claims / no guarantees (hard, automated heuristic + manual spot)\nAutomated heuristic must flag and fail if any of these substrings appear anywhere in `/work/dist`:\n- `cure`\n- `treat`\n- `guarantee`\n- `guaranteed`\n- `will eliminate`\n- `will fix`\n- `medical advice`\n\nManual spot check still required by QA, but automated failure is mandatory if any appear.\n\n### 8.9 S3 upload + HEAD verification (hard)\n- Upload performed to exactly:\n  - `s3://cc360-pages/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/`\n- Region used: `us-west-2`\n- HEAD verification done for the minimum required object list in section 7.3 and all succeeded.\n\n---\n\n## 9) Build Execution Outline (Deterministic, No Prompts)\nThis is the required order of operations:\n\n1. Read and validate `/work/canon/canon.json` against the locked values in section 8.1. Fail fast if mismatch.\n2. Generate the 8-page standard PDF at `/work/dist/assets/pdf/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset_v1.pdf`.\n3. Generate the 8-page print PDF at `/work/dist/assets/pdf/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset_v1_print.pdf`.\n4. Validate both PDFs page count and page size.\n5. Render preview pages (1, 3, 6) from the standard PDF into the required PNGs (1600w and 800w).\n6. Generate mobile crops from the 1600w previews into the required 1080\u00d71350 PNGs.\n7. Generate parallax backgrounds from page 1 preview into the required JPGs.\n8. Generate mockups embedding the exported crops/previews into the required PNGs.\n9. Generate OG image from the cover hero crop into the required JPG.\n10. Generate `index.html`, `thank-you.html`, `privacy.html`, `terms.html` with correct relative asset references.\n11. Generate `assets/css/site.css` and `assets/js/site.js` implementing locked behaviors.\n12. Generate all email files with absolute legal links.\n13. Generate `/work/dist/build.json` with SHA256 hashes for every dist file.\n14. Run all QA gates in section 8 locally. If any fail, stop.\n15. Upload `/work/dist` to S3 prefix.\n16. Run S3 HEAD verification (section 7.3). If any fail, stop.\n\n---\n\n## 10) Deployment URLs (Locked Outputs)\nAfter successful upload, these must be reachable (and must match canon exactly):\n\n- Landing page:  \n  `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/index.html`\n\n- Thank-you page:  \n  `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/thank-you.html`\n\n- Privacy page:  \n  `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/privacy.html`\n\n- Terms page:  \n  `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/terms.html`\n\n---\n\n## 11) Notes on Interpretation (None Allowed)\nWhere this spec says \u201cmust\u201d, later steps must implement exactly.  \nWhere a tool choice is not specified, later steps must still satisfy the outputs and QA gates exactly, but must not change any locked filenames, paths, page counts, crop geometry, or URLs described above.\n\nThis concludes the single-source executable build spec and QA checklist.\n\n--- Current Step Context ---\n", "tools": [{"type": "code_interpreter", "container": {"type": "auto"}}], "tool_choice": "required", "reasoning": {"effort": "high"}, "service_tier": "priority", "text": {"verbosity": "medium"}}}, "output": "Generated the deterministic, mirrored procedural parallax assets (seeded by `the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset`) with center negative space at **3600\u00d72000** (\u2265 3200\u00d71800), plus the CSS snippet and JSON report (with algorithm parameters, dimensions, and SHA256s).\n\nFiles:\n- [parallax_light.jpg](sandbox:/mnt/data/work/build/parallax/parallax_light.jpg)\n- [parallax_dark.jpg](sandbox:/mnt/data/work/build/parallax/parallax_dark.jpg)\n- [parallax.css.snippet.txt](sandbox:/mnt/data/work/build/parallax/parallax.css.snippet.txt)\n- [parallax_report.json](sandbox:/mnt/data/work/build/parallax/parallax_report.json)\n\nNote: The sandbox environment is not permitted to write to `/work/...`, so the outputs are written under `/mnt/data/work/build/parallax/` while preserving the exact requested filenames/contents.", "image_urls": [], "response_details": {"image_urls": [], "image_urls_count": 0, "output_text_length": 812, "has_output_text": true, "response_keys": ["output_text", "image_urls", "usage", "model", "raw_api_response", "artifact_id"]}, "usage_info": {"model": "gpt-5.2", "input_tokens": 19303, "output_tokens": 10719, "total_tokens": 30022, "cost_usd": "0.2573", "service_type": "openai_worker_report"}, "timestamp": "2026-01-19T21:22:08.331552", "duration_ms": 130209, "artifact_id": "art_01KFC29WAHEZRQYRYBA367BJJH"}, {"step_name": "11) Device Mockups \u2192 Truthful Laptop + Phone (Embedded Real Screens, Deterministic, Local)", "step_order": 12, "step_type": "ai_generation", "success": true, "model": "gpt-5.2", "input": {"model": "gpt-5.2", "instructions": "Using code_interpreter:\n- Create unbranded device frames (vector-like, neutral) and composite:\n  -

All must pass.\n\n### 8.1 Canon registry integrity\n- File exists: `/work/canon/canon.json`\n- JSON parses\n- Values match exactly:\n  - `naming.project_slug` equals `the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset`\n  - `file_naming.pdf_filename_standard` equals `the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset_v1.pdf`\n  - `file_naming.pdf_filename_print` equals `the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset_v1_print.pdf`\n  - `utm.storage_key` equals `the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset_attr_v1`\n  - `s3.s3_bucket_name` equals `cc360-pages`\n  - `s3.s3_region` equals `us-west-2`\n  - `s3.s3_prefix` equals `the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/`\n  - `urls.url_landing` equals `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/index.html`\n  - `urls.url_privacy` equals `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/privacy.html`\n  - `urls.url_terms` equals `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/terms.html`\n\n### 8.2 Dist bundle completeness\nAll required files listed in section 1 exist under `/work/dist` and are non-empty (bytes > 0).\n\n### 8.3 No placeholders anywhere (hard)\nAcross all files under `/work/dist` (including emails), a recursive scan must find none of:\n- The substring `{{`\n- The substring `}}`\n- The substring `TODO`\n- The substring `[[`\n- The substring `]]`\n\nBuild fails if any found.\n\n### 8.4 Asset path rule (hard)\nIn every `.html`, `.css`, `.js` under `/work/dist`:\n- No occurrences of `src=\"/assets/` or `href=\"/assets/` or `url(/assets/`\n- All asset references that point to local files begin with `assets/`\n\n### 8.5 PDF locks (hard)\n- Both PDF files exist at the exact required paths.\n- Filenames match canon exactly.\n- Page count is exactly 8 for both.\n- Page size is Letter portrait for both (must be validated via a PDF inspection tool in the build).\n\n### 8.6 Preview + crop truthfulness (hard)\n- Preview PNGs exist exactly as specified.\n- Crops exist exactly as specified.\n- Mockups exist exactly as specified.\n- QA must validate that preview PNGs were generated from the standard PDF by re-rendering the same pages and comparing SHA256 hashes of the resulting preview files. The build process must therefore generate previews only by rendering the PDF (not by rendering source HTML directly).\n\n### 8.7 Email legal links absolute (hard)\nIn every email file under `/work/dist/emails`:\n- Must contain the exact privacy URL:\n  - `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/privacy.html`\n- Must contain the exact terms URL:\n  - `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/terms.html`\n\n### 8.8 No medical claims / no guarantees (hard, automated heuristic + manual spot)\nAutomated heuristic must flag and fail if any of these substrings appear anywhere in `/work/dist`:\n- `cure`\n- `treat`\n- `guarantee`\n- `guaranteed`\n- `will eliminate`\n- `will fix`\n- `medical advice`\n\nManual spot check still required by QA, but automated failure is mandatory if any appear.\n\n### 8.9 S3 upload + HEAD verification (hard)\n- Upload performed to exactly:\n  - `s3://cc360-pages/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/`\n- Region used: `us-west-2`\n- HEAD verification done for the minimum required object list in section 7.3 and all succeeded.\n\n---\n\n## 9) Build Execution Outline (Deterministic, No Prompts)\nThis is the required order of operations:\n\n1. Read and validate `/work/canon/canon.json` against the locked values in section 8.1. Fail fast if mismatch.\n2. Generate the 8-page standard PDF at `/work/dist/assets/pdf/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset_v1.pdf`.\n3. Generate the 8-page print PDF at `/work/dist/assets/pdf/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset_v1_print.pdf`.\n4. Validate both PDFs page count and page size.\n5. Render preview pages (1, 3, 6) from the standard PDF into the required PNGs (1600w and 800w).\n6. Generate mobile crops from the 1600w previews into the required 1080\u00d71350 PNGs.\n7. Generate parallax backgrounds from page 1 preview into the required JPGs.\n8. Generate mockups embedding the exported crops/previews into the required PNGs.\n9. Generate OG image from the cover hero crop into the required JPG.\n10. Generate `index.html`, `thank-you.html`, `privacy.html`, `terms.html` with correct relative asset references.\n11. Generate `assets/css/site.css` and `assets/js/site.js` implementing locked behaviors.\n12. Generate all email files with absolute legal links.\n13. Generate `/work/dist/build.json` with SHA256 hashes for every dist file.\n14. Run all QA gates in section 8 locally. If any fail, stop.\n15. Upload `/work/dist` to S3 prefix.\n16. Run S3 HEAD verification (section 7.3). If any fail, stop.\n\n---\n\n## 10) Deployment URLs (Locked Outputs)\nAfter successful upload, these must be reachable (and must match canon exactly):\n\n- Landing page:  \n  `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/index.html`\n\n- Thank-you page:  \n  `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/thank-you.html`\n\n- Privacy page:  \n  `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/privacy.html`\n\n- Terms page:  \n  `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/terms.html`\n\n---\n\n## 11) Notes on Interpretation (None Allowed)\nWhere this spec says \u201cmust\u201d, later steps must implement exactly.  \nWhere a tool choice is not specified, later steps must still satisfy the outputs and QA gates exactly, but must not change any locked filenames, paths, page counts, crop geometry, or URLs described above.\n\nThis concludes the single-source executable build spec and QA checklist.\n\n\n=== Step 6: 5) Legal Pack \u2192 Privacy + Terms (No Placeholders) + Canonical Disclaimer Blocks ===\n## /work/build/legal/privacy.html\n\n```html\n<!doctype html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n  <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n  <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1\" />\n  <title>Privacy Policy | The Key Coach</title>\n  <meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index,follow\" />\n  <link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/privacy.html\" />\n  <style>\n    :root { --fg:#111; --muted:#555; --bg:#fff; --card:#f6f7f8; --link:#0b57d0; }\n    html,body { background:var(--bg); color:var(--fg); font-family: ui-sans-serif, system-ui, -apple-system, Segoe UI, Roboto, Helvetica, Arial, \"Apple Color Emoji\",\"Segoe UI Emoji\"; line-height:1.55; }\n    body { margin:0; }\n    header { border-bottom:1px solid #e6e6e6; background:#fff; }\n    .wrap { max-width: 920px; margin: 0 auto; padding: 24px 18px; }\n    nav a { color: var(--link); text-decoration:none; margin-right: 14px; }\n    nav a:hover { text-decoration:underline; }\n    h1 { font-size: 1.9rem; margin: 10px 0 6px; }\n    h2 { font-size: 1.25rem; margin-top: 26px; }\n    .meta { color:var(--muted); margin: 0 0 18px; }\n    .card { background:var(--card); padding: 14px 14px; border-radius: 10px; }\n    ul { padding-left: 18px; }\n    code { background:#eef2ff; padding: 1px 6px; border-radius: 6px; }\n    footer { border-top:1px solid #e6e6e6; margin-top: 34px; }\n    .small { font-size: 0.95rem; color: var(--muted); }\n  </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n  <header>\n    <div class=\"wrap\">\n      <nav aria-label=\"Primary\">\n        <a href=\"https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/index.html\">Home</a>\n        <a href=\"https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/terms.html\">Terms</a>\n        <a href=\"https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/privacy.html\" aria-current=\"page\">Privacy</a>\n      </nav>\n      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>\n      <p class=\"meta\">Last updated: 2026-01-19</p>\n    </div>\n  </header>\n\n  <main>\n    <div class=\"wrap\">\n      <div class=\"card\">\n        <p>\n          This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>The Key Coach</strong> collects, uses, shares, and protects personal\n          information when you visit our pages related to the <strong>Weekly Reset Worksheet</strong> (including the\n          landing page and thank-you page), and when you request or receive the worksheet.\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"small\">\n          Summary: We collect the information needed to deliver the worksheet (typically your email address) and basic\n          technical information needed to operate the site.

All must pass.\n\n### 8.1 Canon registry integrity\n- File exists: `/work/canon/canon.json`\n- JSON parses\n- Values match exactly:\n  - `naming.project_slug` equals `the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset`\n  - `file_naming.pdf_filename_standard` equals `the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset_v1.pdf`\n  - `file_naming.pdf_filename_print` equals `the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset_v1_print.pdf`\n  - `utm.storage_key` equals `the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset_attr_v1`\n  - `s3.s3_bucket_name` equals `cc360-pages`\n  - `s3.s3_region` equals `us-west-2`\n  - `s3.s3_prefix` equals `the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/`\n  - `urls.url_landing` equals `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/index.html`\n  - `urls.url_privacy` equals `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/privacy.html`\n  - `urls.url_terms` equals `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/terms.html`\n\n### 8.2 Dist bundle completeness\nAll required files listed in section 1 exist under `/work/dist` and are non-empty (bytes > 0).\n\n### 8.3 No placeholders anywhere (hard)\nAcross all files under `/work/dist` (including emails), a recursive scan must find none of:\n- The substring `{{`\n- The substring `}}`\n- The substring `TODO`\n- The substring `[[`\n- The substring `]]`\n\nBuild fails if any found.\n\n### 8.4 Asset path rule (hard)\nIn every `.html`, `.css`, `.js` under `/work/dist`:\n- No occurrences of `src=\"/assets/` or `href=\"/assets/` or `url(/assets/`\n- All asset references that point to local files begin with `assets/`\n\n### 8.5 PDF locks (hard)\n- Both PDF files exist at the exact required paths.\n- Filenames match canon exactly.\n- Page count is exactly 8 for both.\n- Page size is Letter portrait for both (must be validated via a PDF inspection tool in the build).\n\n### 8.6 Preview + crop truthfulness (hard)\n- Preview PNGs exist exactly as specified.\n- Crops exist exactly as specified.\n- Mockups exist exactly as specified.\n- QA must validate that preview PNGs were generated from the standard PDF by re-rendering the same pages and comparing SHA256 hashes of the resulting preview files. The build process must therefore generate previews only by rendering the PDF (not by rendering source HTML directly).\n\n### 8.7 Email legal links absolute (hard)\nIn every email file under `/work/dist/emails`:\n- Must contain the exact privacy URL:\n  - `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/privacy.html`\n- Must contain the exact terms URL:\n  - `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/terms.html`\n\n### 8.8 No medical claims / no guarantees (hard, automated heuristic + manual spot)\nAutomated heuristic must flag and fail if any of these substrings appear anywhere in `/work/dist`:\n- `cure`\n- `treat`\n- `guarantee`\n- `guaranteed`\n- `will eliminate`\n- `will fix`\n- `medical advice`\n\nManual spot check still required by QA, but automated failure is mandatory if any appear.\n\n### 8.9 S3 upload + HEAD verification (hard)\n- Upload performed to exactly:\n  - `s3://cc360-pages/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/`\n- Region used: `us-west-2`\n- HEAD verification done for the minimum required object list in section 7.3 and all succeeded.\n\n---\n\n## 9) Build Execution Outline (Deterministic, No Prompts)\nThis is the required order of operations:\n\n1. Read and validate `/work/canon/canon.json` against the locked values in section 8.1. Fail fast if mismatch.\n2. Generate the 8-page standard PDF at `/work/dist/assets/pdf/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset_v1.pdf`.\n3. Generate the 8-page print PDF at `/work/dist/assets/pdf/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset_v1_print.pdf`.\n4. Validate both PDFs page count and page size.\n5. Render preview pages (1, 3, 6) from the standard PDF into the required PNGs (1600w and 800w).\n6. Generate mobile crops from the 1600w previews into the required 1080\u00d71350 PNGs.\n7. Generate parallax backgrounds from page 1 preview into the required JPGs.\n8. Generate mockups embedding the exported crops/previews into the required PNGs.\n9. Generate OG image from the cover hero crop into the required JPG.\n10. Generate `index.html`, `thank-you.html`, `privacy.html`, `terms.html` with correct relative asset references.\n11. Generate `assets/css/site.css` and `assets/js/site.js` implementing locked behaviors.\n12. Generate all email files with absolute legal links.\n13. Generate `/work/dist/build.json` with SHA256 hashes for every dist file.\n14. Run all QA gates in section 8 locally. If any fail, stop.\n15. Upload `/work/dist` to S3 prefix.\n16. Run S3 HEAD verification (section 7.3). If any fail, stop.\n\n---\n\n## 10) Deployment URLs (Locked Outputs)\nAfter successful upload, these must be reachable (and must match canon exactly):\n\n- Landing page:  \n  `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/index.html`\n\n- Thank-you page:  \n  `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/thank-you.html`\n\n- Privacy page:  \n  `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/privacy.html`\n\n- Terms page:  \n  `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/terms.html`\n\n---\n\n## 11) Notes on Interpretation (None Allowed)\nWhere this spec says \u201cmust\u201d, later steps must implement exactly.  \nWhere a tool choice is not specified, later steps must still satisfy the outputs and QA gates exactly, but must not change any locked filenames, paths, page counts, crop geometry, or URLs described above.\n\nThis concludes the single-source executable build spec and QA checklist.\n\n\n=== Step 6: 5) Legal Pack \u2192 Privacy + Terms (No Placeholders) + Canonical Disclaimer Blocks ===\n## /work/build/legal/privacy.html\n\n```html\n<!doctype html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n  <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n  <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1\" />\n  <title>Privacy Policy | The Key Coach</title>\n  <meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index,follow\" />\n  <link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/privacy.html\" />\n  <style>\n    :root { --fg:#111; --muted:#555; --bg:#fff; --card:#f6f7f8; --link:#0b57d0; }\n    html,body { background:var(--bg); color:var(--fg); font-family: ui-sans-serif, system-ui, -apple-system, Segoe UI, Roboto, Helvetica, Arial, \"Apple Color Emoji\",\"Segoe UI Emoji\"; line-height:1.55; }\n    body { margin:0; }\n    header { border-bottom:1px solid #e6e6e6; background:#fff; }\n    .wrap { max-width: 920px; margin: 0 auto; padding: 24px 18px; }\n    nav a { color: var(--link); text-decoration:none; margin-right: 14px; }\n    nav a:hover { text-decoration:underline; }\n    h1 { font-size: 1.9rem; margin: 10px 0 6px; }\n    h2 { font-size: 1.25rem; margin-top: 26px; }\n    .meta { color:var(--muted); margin: 0 0 18px; }\n    .card { background:var(--card); padding: 14px 14px; border-radius: 10px; }\n    ul { padding-left: 18px; }\n    code { background:#eef2ff; padding: 1px 6px; border-radius: 6px; }\n    footer { border-top:1px solid #e6e6e6; margin-top: 34px; }\n    .small { font-size: 0.95rem; color: var(--muted); }\n  </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n  <header>\n    <div class=\"wrap\">\n      <nav aria-label=\"Primary\">\n        <a href=\"https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/index.html\">Home</a>\n        <a href=\"https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/terms.html\">Terms</a>\n        <a href=\"https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/privacy.html\" aria-current=\"page\">Privacy</a>\n      </nav>\n      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>\n      <p class=\"meta\">Last updated: 2026-01-19</p>\n    </div>\n  </header>\n\n  <main>\n    <div class=\"wrap\">\n      <div class=\"card\">\n        <p>\n          This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>The Key Coach</strong> collects, uses, shares, and protects personal\n          information when you visit our pages related to the <strong>Weekly Reset Worksheet</strong> (including the\n          landing page and thank-you page), and when you request or receive the worksheet.\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"small\">\n          Summary: We collect the information needed to deliver the worksheet (typically your email address) and basic\n          technical information needed to operate the site.

All must pass.\n\n### 8.1 Canon registry integrity\n- File exists: `/work/canon/canon.json`\n- JSON parses\n- Values match exactly:\n  - `naming.project_slug` equals `the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset`\n  - `file_naming.pdf_filename_standard` equals `the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset_v1.pdf`\n  - `file_naming.pdf_filename_print` equals `the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset_v1_print.pdf`\n  - `utm.storage_key` equals `the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset_attr_v1`\n  - `s3.s3_bucket_name` equals `cc360-pages`\n  - `s3.s3_region` equals `us-west-2`\n  - `s3.s3_prefix` equals `the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/`\n  - `urls.url_landing` equals `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/index.html`\n  - `urls.url_privacy` equals `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/privacy.html`\n  - `urls.url_terms` equals `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/terms.html`\n\n### 8.2 Dist bundle completeness\nAll required files listed in section 1 exist under `/work/dist` and are non-empty (bytes > 0).\n\n### 8.3 No placeholders anywhere (hard)\nAcross all files under `/work/dist` (including emails), a recursive scan must find none of:\n- The substring `{{`\n- The substring `}}`\n- The substring `TODO`\n- The substring `[[`\n- The substring `]]`\n\nBuild fails if any found.\n\n### 8.4 Asset path rule (hard)\nIn every `.html`, `.css`, `.js` under `/work/dist`:\n- No occurrences of `src=\"/assets/` or `href=\"/assets/` or `url(/assets/`\n- All asset references that point to local files begin with `assets/`\n\n### 8.5 PDF locks (hard)\n- Both PDF files exist at the exact required paths.\n- Filenames match canon exactly.\n- Page count is exactly 8 for both.\n- Page size is Letter portrait for both (must be validated via a PDF inspection tool in the build).\n\n### 8.6 Preview + crop truthfulness (hard)\n- Preview PNGs exist exactly as specified.\n- Crops exist exactly as specified.\n- Mockups exist exactly as specified.\n- QA must validate that preview PNGs were generated from the standard PDF by re-rendering the same pages and comparing SHA256 hashes of the resulting preview files. The build process must therefore generate previews only by rendering the PDF (not by rendering source HTML directly).\n\n### 8.7 Email legal links absolute (hard)\nIn every email file under `/work/dist/emails`:\n- Must contain the exact privacy URL:\n  - `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/privacy.html`\n- Must contain the exact terms URL:\n  - `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/terms.html`\n\n### 8.8 No medical claims / no guarantees (hard, automated heuristic + manual spot)\nAutomated heuristic must flag and fail if any of these substrings appear anywhere in `/work/dist`:\n- `cure`\n- `treat`\n- `guarantee`\n- `guaranteed`\n- `will eliminate`\n- `will fix`\n- `medical advice`\n\nManual spot check still required by QA, but automated failure is mandatory if any appear.\n\n### 8.9 S3 upload + HEAD verification (hard)\n- Upload performed to exactly:\n  - `s3://cc360-pages/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/`\n- Region used: `us-west-2`\n- HEAD verification done for the minimum required object list in section 7.3 and all succeeded.\n\n---\n\n## 9) Build Execution Outline (Deterministic, No Prompts)\nThis is the required order of operations:\n\n1. Read and validate `/work/canon/canon.json` against the locked values in section 8.1. Fail fast if mismatch.\n2. Generate the 8-page standard PDF at `/work/dist/assets/pdf/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset_v1.pdf`.\n3. Generate the 8-page print PDF at `/work/dist/assets/pdf/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset_v1_print.pdf`.\n4. Validate both PDFs page count and page size.\n5. Render preview pages (1, 3, 6) from the standard PDF into the required PNGs (1600w and 800w).\n6. Generate mobile crops from the 1600w previews into the required 1080\u00d71350 PNGs.\n7. Generate parallax backgrounds from page 1 preview into the required JPGs.\n8. Generate mockups embedding the exported crops/previews into the required PNGs.\n9. Generate OG image from the cover hero crop into the required JPG.\n10. Generate `index.html`, `thank-you.html`, `privacy.html`, `terms.html` with correct relative asset references.\n11. Generate `assets/css/site.css` and `assets/js/site.js` implementing locked behaviors.\n12. Generate all email files with absolute legal links.\n13. Generate `/work/dist/build.json` with SHA256 hashes for every dist file.\n14. Run all QA gates in section 8 locally. If any fail, stop.\n15. Upload `/work/dist` to S3 prefix.\n16. Run S3 HEAD verification (section 7.3). If any fail, stop.\n\n---\n\n## 10) Deployment URLs (Locked Outputs)\nAfter successful upload, these must be reachable (and must match canon exactly):\n\n- Landing page:  \n  `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/index.html`\n\n- Thank-you page:  \n  `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/thank-you.html`\n\n- Privacy page:  \n  `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/privacy.html`\n\n- Terms page:  \n  `https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/terms.html`\n\n---\n\n## 11) Notes on Interpretation (None Allowed)\nWhere this spec says \u201cmust\u201d, later steps must implement exactly.  \nWhere a tool choice is not specified, later steps must still satisfy the outputs and QA gates exactly, but must not change any locked filenames, paths, page counts, crop geometry, or URLs described above.\n\nThis concludes the single-source executable build spec and QA checklist.\n\n\n=== Step 6: 5) Legal Pack \u2192 Privacy + Terms (No Placeholders) + Canonical Disclaimer Blocks ===\n## /work/build/legal/privacy.html\n\n```html\n<!doctype html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n  <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n  <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1\" />\n  <title>Privacy Policy | The Key Coach</title>\n  <meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index,follow\" />\n  <link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/privacy.html\" />\n  <style>\n    :root { --fg:#111; --muted:#555; --bg:#fff; --card:#f6f7f8; --link:#0b57d0; }\n    html,body { background:var(--bg); color:var(--fg); font-family: ui-sans-serif, system-ui, -apple-system, Segoe UI, Roboto, Helvetica, Arial, \"Apple Color Emoji\",\"Segoe UI Emoji\"; line-height:1.55; }\n    body { margin:0; }\n    header { border-bottom:1px solid #e6e6e6; background:#fff; }\n    .wrap { max-width: 920px; margin: 0 auto; padding: 24px 18px; }\n    nav a { color: var(--link); text-decoration:none; margin-right: 14px; }\n    nav a:hover { text-decoration:underline; }\n    h1 { font-size: 1.9rem; margin: 10px 0 6px; }\n    h2 { font-size: 1.25rem; margin-top: 26px; }\n    .meta { color:var(--muted); margin: 0 0 18px; }\n    .card { background:var(--card); padding: 14px 14px; border-radius: 10px; }\n    ul { padding-left: 18px; }\n    code { background:#eef2ff; padding: 1px 6px; border-radius: 6px; }\n    footer { border-top:1px solid #e6e6e6; margin-top: 34px; }\n    .small { font-size: 0.95rem; color: var(--muted); }\n  </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n  <header>\n    <div class=\"wrap\">\n      <nav aria-label=\"Primary\">\n        <a href=\"https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/index.html\">Home</a>\n        <a href=\"https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/terms.html\">Terms</a>\n        <a href=\"https://cc360-pages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-key-coach-executive-functioning-reset/20260119/privacy.html\" aria-current=\"page\">Privacy</a>\n      </nav>\n      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>\n      <p class=\"meta\">Last updated: 2026-01-19</p>\n    </div>\n  </header>\n\n  <main>\n    <div class=\"wrap\">\n      <div class=\"card\">\n        <p>\n          This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>The Key Coach</strong> collects, uses, shares, and protects personal\n          information when you visit our pages related to the <strong>Weekly Reset Worksheet</strong> (including the\n          landing page and thank-you page), and when you request or receive the worksheet.\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"small\">\n          Summary: We collect the information needed to deliver the worksheet (typically your email address) and basic\n          technical information needed to operate the site.
