He overprepared, discovering that resources were fragmented and rarely blended case, PEI, and the new digital screens. As an ex-McKinsey consultant, interviewer, and internally recognized Top Coach, he built the system he wished he’d had: one integrity-first, interviewer-grade path that demystifies every step. The program combines firm-specific modules (McKinsey Solve, BCG Casey, Bain digital assessments), a PEI Story Bank Builder, and a single readiness rubric with go/no-go gates. With small-group hot-seat cohorts and premium 1:1 options, candidates replace overwhelm with a 6–8 week plan, practice exactly what interviewers say 'yes' to, and walk into interviews offer-ready—without violating any firm rules.""
