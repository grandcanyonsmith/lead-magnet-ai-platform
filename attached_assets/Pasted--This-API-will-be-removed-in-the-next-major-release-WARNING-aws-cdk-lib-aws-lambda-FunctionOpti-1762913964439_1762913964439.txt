# 2. Commit
git commit -m "Fix: Add missing worker modules for multi-step execution

Restores 4 missing Python modules required by the worker:
- error_utils.py - Error normalization
- step_utils.py - Step order handling  
- context_builder.py - AI context management
- execution_step_manager.py - Step record creation

This fixes the issue where jobs stopped after step 3 instead of completing all 6-7 workflow steps."
